## Grabpic: Intelligent Identity & Retrieval Engine

**Time:** 1h:45m | **Domain:** Backend | **Difficulty:** Medium

### Concept
Grabpic is a high-performance image processing backend designed for large-scale events. Imagine a marathon with 500 runners, photographers taking 50,000 photos. Instead of manual tagging, Grabpic uses facial recognition to automatically group images and provide a secure "Selfie-as-a-Key" retrieval system.

### Requirements

#### Discovery & Transformation
- Your system must crawl a storage to ingest and index raw data/images.
- Use facial recognition to assign a unique internal `grab_id` to every unique face discovered.
- A single image might contain multiple people. Your schema must map one image to many `grab_ids`.
- Persist the mapping and image identifiers in a relational or vector-capable database.

#### Selfie Authentication
- Users should be able to authenticate using an image file (the search token).
- Compare the input face against your known `grab_ids`. It should return a `grab_id` which acts as an authorizer.

#### Data Extraction
- An endpoint for fetching user's images.

#### Nice to have
- **Docs:** Postman or Swagger
- Unit tests
- Schema & Architecture design

### Judging Criteria
- **Working API/s:** 25%
- **Face to ID transformation:** 20%
- **Selfie Auth:** 15%
